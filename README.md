In this practical work we have analysies a dataset from `iris.csv` file.

As instructed from the question paper, the data is explored through reading it from the data sheet. 

There are 5 categories:
    1. sepal length
    2. sepal width
    3. petal length
    4. petal width
    5. variety

Several ways of machine learning, such as clustering and classification were used in training and testing the model.

With classification, the training data was set to 70% and testing 30%

The following are result values for a logistic regression model:
- Accuracy:  82.22%
- Precision:  80.83%
- Recall:  79.49%
- F1 score:  78.99%

The following are results for the k-nearest neighbours classifier with k=3:
- Accuracy:  75.55%
- Precision:  80.83%
- Recall:  79.49%
- F1 score:  78.99%

Support vector machine classifier results based on all four columns:
- Accuracy:  0.8
- Precision:  77.5%
- Recall:  76.92%
- F1 score:  76.61%
